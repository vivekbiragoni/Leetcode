### Explanation of the `eventualSafeNodes` Function

This code is designed to solve the problem of finding all "eventual safe nodes" in a directed graph. A node is considered safe if all paths starting from that node eventually lead to a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges). The function returns a list of all such safe nodes.

#### 1. **Function: `dfs`**

- **Purpose**: The `dfs` function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph and mark nodes as safe or unsafe.
  
- **Parameters**:
  - `int node`: The current node being visited.
  - `vector<vector<int>>& graph`: The adjacency list representation of the graph.
  - `vector<int>& vis`: A vector to mark nodes that have been visited.
  - `vector<int>& pathvis`: A vector to track the nodes in the current path of the DFS. It helps detect cycles.
  - `vector<int>& check`: A vector to mark whether a node is safe (`1` if safe, `0` otherwise).

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Mark the current node as visited (`vis[node] = 1`) and part of the current path (`pathvis[node] = 1`).
  2. Initialize the node as unsafe (`check[node] = 0`).
  3. For each neighbor `it` of the current node:
     - If the neighbor is unvisited, recursively perform DFS on it.
     - If the neighbor is visited and part of the current path (`pathvis[it]`), a cycle is detected, so the current node is marked unsafe.
  4. If no cycles are detected, mark the node as safe (`check[node] = 1`).
  5. Remove the node from the current path (`pathvis[node] = 0`) before returning.

- **Returns**: `true` if a cycle is detected; `false` otherwise.

#### 2. **Function: `eventualSafeNodes`**

- **Purpose**: This function identifies all safe nodes in the graph by calling `dfs` on each unvisited node and returns a sorted list of these nodes.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Initialization**:
     - `int n`: The number of nodes in the graph.
     - `vector<int> vis(n, 0)`: A vector to track visited nodes.
     - `vector<int> pathvis(n, 0)`: A vector to track the current DFS path.
     - `vector<int> check(n, 0)`: A vector to mark nodes as safe or unsafe.
     - `vector<int> safeNodes`: A vector to store the list of safe nodes.
  2. **DFS Execution**:
     - For each node `i` from `0` to `n-1`, if the node is unvisited, call `dfs` to explore it and mark it as safe or unsafe.
  3. **Collect Safe Nodes**:
     - After all nodes are processed, iterate through the `check` vector. If a node is marked as safe (`check[i] == 1`), add it to the `safeNodes` list.
  4. **Return**: The list `safeNodes` is returned, containing all safe nodes.

### Key Concepts

- **Cycle Detection**: The main challenge is to detect cycles in the graph using DFS. A node involved in a cycle is marked unsafe.
- **Backtracking**: The algorithm backtracks by removing nodes from `pathvis` as the DFS unwinds, ensuring that only nodes in the current path are checked for cycles.
- **Topological Sorting**: While not explicitly mentioned, the approach resembles topological sorting where nodes are processed only after all their neighbors are processed.

### Example Walkthrough

For a graph represented as `graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]`:
- Nodes `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` are involved in cycles or lead to cycles, so they are unsafe.
- Nodes `4`, `5`, `6` are safe because they either lead to terminal nodes or are terminal themselves.
- The function will return `[4, 5, 6]` as the list of safe nodes.

### Important Notes

- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in `O(V + E)` time, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges, making it efficient for typical graph problems.
- **Memory**: The space complexity is `O(V)` due to the vectors used to track visited nodes, current paths, and safe nodes.
