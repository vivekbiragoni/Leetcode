### Problem Overview
The problem is to find the largest rectangular area that can be formed in a histogram. The heights of the bars in the histogram are given as an array `heights`, where each element represents the height of a bar. The task is to determine the maximum rectangular area that can be formed using contiguous bars.

### Approach

The code uses a stack-based approach to efficiently find the largest rectangle. The idea is to use the stack to keep track of the indices of the histogram bars in increasing order of their heights. The stack helps in determining the boundaries (next smaller element to the right and previous smaller element to the left) for each bar, which in turn allows calculating the area of the rectangle with that bar as the smallest height.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: The size of the `heights` vector.
   - `stack<int> st`: A stack to keep track of indices of bars.
   - `int maxarea = -1e9`: A variable to store the maximum area found. It is initialized to a very small value to ensure any area calculated will be larger.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each bar in the histogram. For each bar at index `i`:
     - **Pop from Stack**: While the stack is not empty and the current bar's height is less than the height of the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack (`heights[st.top()]`), the code pops from the stack. This identifies the current bar as the right boundary (Next Smaller Element, `nse`) for the rectangle formed by the bar at `st.top()`.
     - **Calculate Area**: Once the top element of the stack is popped, the code calculates the area of the rectangle where `heights[element]` is the smallest bar, `nse` is the current index `i`, and `pse` (Previous Smaller Element) is either the index at the new top of the stack (after popping) or `-1` if the stack is empty. The area is calculated using:
       \[
       \text{area} = \text{heights[element]} \times (\text{nse} - \text{pse} - 1)
       \]
       The maximum area is updated if this area is larger.
     - **Push Current Index**: After processing, the current index `i` is pushed onto the stack.

3. **Final Stack Processing**:
   - After the loop, there may still be elements in the stack that need processing. For these elements:
     - The code calculates the area as if the right boundary is at `n` (the end of the histogram).
     - The same area calculation is performed as in the main loop, with the right boundary being `n` and the left boundary being the next element in the stack or `-1`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the maximum area found is returned.

### Example Walkthrough
- **Example**: For the histogram `heights = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]`:
  - The stack is used to find the boundaries for each bar.
  - The maximum rectangle found would have an area of `10`, formed by bars with height `5` and `6`.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) - Each bar is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) - The stack can hold all bars in the worst case.

This method is efficient and avoids the need for nested loops, making it a well-suited approach for large histograms.
