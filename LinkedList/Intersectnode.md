To find the intersection node of two linked lists, you can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Lengths:** Traverse both linked lists and calculate their lengths.
2. **Adjust Pointers:** Determine the length difference between the two lists. Move the pointer of the longer list ahead by the difference in lengths. Now both lists are equidistant from the intersection point.
3. **Traverse Both Lists:** Traverse both lists simultaneously until you find the intersection node. This is done by comparing the nodes at each step. If the nodes are equal, it means you've found the intersection. If you reach the end of either list without finding an intersection, it means there's no intersection.
4. **Return Intersection Node:** If an intersection node is found, return it. Otherwise, return null or indicate that there's no intersection.

This approach takes O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the lengths of the two linked lists, respectively.

Here's a high-level code snippet to illustrate this approach:

```cpp
ListNode* getIntersectionNode(ListNode* headA, ListNode* headB) {
    // Calculate lengths of both lists
    int lenA = 0, lenB = 0;
    ListNode* currA = headA;
    ListNode* currB = headB;
    while (currA) {
        lenA++;
        currA = currA->next;
    }
    while (currB) {
        lenB++;
        currB = currB->next;
    }
    
    // Adjust pointers to make both lists equidistant from the intersection
    currA = headA;
    currB = headB;
    int diff = abs(lenA - lenB);
    if (lenA > lenB) {
        while (diff--) {
            currA = currA->next;
        }
    } else {
        while (diff--) {
            currB = currB->next;
        }
    }
    
    // Traverse both lists simultaneously until intersection is found
    while (currA && currB) {
        if (currA == currB) {
            return currA; // Intersection found
        }
        currA = currA->next;
        currB = currB->next;
    }
    
    return nullptr; // No intersection found
}
```

This code calculates the lengths of both lists, adjusts the pointers to make them equidistant from the intersection, and then traverses both lists simultaneously until the intersection node is found or the end of either list is reached.
