The notes based on the latest optimized solution for counting the number of set bits in numbers from `0` to `n` in linear time.

### Notes on Optimized Solution for Counting Set Bits

#### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `n`, generate an array of size `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` represents the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `i`.

#### Key Insight
To achieve a linear time solution, we can use dynamic programming. The number of set bits in a number `i` can be derived from a previously computed result.

#### Dynamic Programming Approach
- **Recurrence Relation**:
  \[ \text{countBits}(i) = \text{countBits}(i \gg 1) + (i \& 1) \]
  - `i >> 1` is equivalent to `i / 2`.
  - `(i & 1)` checks if the least significant bit (LSB) is set (1 if odd, 0 if even).

- **Explanation**:
  - If `i` is even, `i` has the same number of set bits as `i / 2`.
  - If `i` is odd, `i` has one more set bit than `i / 2`.

#### Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        std::vector<int> result(n + 1, 0); // Initialize a vector of size n+1 with 0

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            result[i] = result[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Steps in Code
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a vector `result` of size `n + 1`, initialized to 0.

2. **Filling the Result Vector**:
   - Loop from `1` to `n`.
   - Use the recurrence relation to compute the number of set bits for each `i` and store it in `result[i]`.

#### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: \(O(n)\)
- **Loop Execution**: \(O(n)\)
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

#### Summary
- This approach ensures that we compute the number of set bits for each number from `0` to `n` in linear time \(O(n)\).
- By leveraging dynamic programming and previously computed results, we achieve an efficient solution that works in a single pass.
