The `combinationSum` function within the `Solution` class. We will use the backtracking approach
Hereâ€™s how we can implement it in the context of your class:

1. **Define the `combinationSum` method in the `Solution` class:**
   - This method will initialize the result list and call the backtracking helper function.
   
2. **Define the backtracking helper function:**
   - The helper function will recursively explore all possible combinations.
Sure, Vivek! The problem you're describing is a classic example of the "Combination Sum" problem. This problem can be solved using a backtracking approach. The idea is to explore all possible combinations by recursively trying out each candidate and tracking the current combination of numbers.

### Steps to Solve Combination Sum Problem using Backtracking

1. **Sort the candidates (optional):** Sorting can help in optimizing the backtracking process, but it's not strictly necessary.

2. **Define a helper function for backtracking:**
   - This function will take the current index, the current target, and the current combination as parameters.
   - If the target becomes zero, add the current combination to the result list.
   - If the target becomes negative or if we've considered all candidates, backtrack.
   - Recursively try each candidate, including it in the current combination and decreasing the target accordingly.

3. **Start the backtracking process from the main function:**
   - Initialize the result list and call the helper function with initial parameters.


### Explanation:

1. **Backtracking Function (`backtrack`):**
   - The function takes the `candidates` array, `target` value, `combination` list, `result` list, and the `start` index.
   - If `target` is zero, it means the current combination sums up to the original target, so it's added to the result.
   - If `target` becomes negative, it means the current combination exceeds the target, so we backtrack.
   - The loop iterates over the candidates starting from `start` index, allowing the same element to be used multiple times.
   - Each candidate is added to the current combination, and the `target` is reduced by the candidate's value.
   - The `backtrack` function is called recursively with the updated combination and target.
   - After exploring with the current candidate, it is removed from the combination to explore other possibilities.

2. **Main Function (`combinationSum`):**
   - Initializes the result and combination lists.
   - Calls the `backtrack` function with initial parameters.
   - Returns the result list containing all valid combinations.

### Example Execution:

For `candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7]` and `target = 7`:
- The backtracking will explore combinations like `[2, 2, 3]`, `[7]`, and so on.
- Each valid combination that sums to `7` is added to the result list.

For `candidates = [2, 3, 5]` and `target = 8`:
- The backtracking will explore combinations like `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, `[2, 3, 3]`, `[3, 5]`, and so on.


### Explanation:

1. **`combinationSum` Method:**
   - Initializes the result vector and calls the `backtrack` helper function with the initial parameters.
   
2. **`backtrack` Helper Function:**
   - **Parameters:** Takes the candidates vector, target sum, current combination, result vector, and the start index.
   - **Base Case:** 
     - If the target becomes 0, it means we found a valid combination. So, we add the current combination to the result vector.
     - If the target becomes negative, it means the current combination exceeds the target, and we return (backtrack).
   - **Recursive Step:**
     - Iterate over the candidates starting from the `start` index.
     - Include the candidate in the current combination and recursively call `backtrack` with the updated target.
     - After returning from the recursive call, remove the last added candidate to explore other possibilities (backtrack).

3. **Main Function:**
   - Demonstrates how to use the `Solution` class and prints the result for the given example inputs.

This implementation ensures that all unique combinations that sum up to the target are found. If you need further explanations or modifications, feel free to ask!
