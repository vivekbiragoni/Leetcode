### Submission Notes for `myPow` Implementation

#### Overview

The provided code implements the `myPow` function, which efficiently computes the power of a given base to an integer exponent. This implementation follows the exponentiation by squaring technique to reduce the number of multiplications needed for large exponents. The code ensures correct handling of negative exponents and potential overflow conditions.

#### Key Components

1. **Efficient Exponentiation**: The `myPow` function applies the exponentiation by squaring technique, which significantly reduces the number of multiplication operations required to compute the result. It iteratively squares the base and halves the exponent until the exponent becomes 0.

2. **Handling Negative Exponents**: The implementation correctly handles negative exponents by taking the reciprocal of the result if the original exponent is negative. This ensures accurate computation of fractional powers.

3. **Overflow Handling**: The code checks for potential overflow conditions during the computation by comparing the intermediate result with the maximum and minimum values of the integer type. If overflow is detected, the function clamps the result to `INT_MAX` or `INT_MIN` accordingly.

4. **Loop Optimization**: The loop in the `myPow` function efficiently handles both odd and even exponents, avoiding unnecessary multiplications and divisions. This optimization contributes to the overall efficiency of the exponentiation process.

5. **Standard C++ Usage**: The implementation adheres to standard C++ conventions and does not rely on external libraries or non-standard features, ensuring compatibility and portability across different environments.

#### Clarification Questions Addressed

- **Why is `long long` used for the exponent?**
  - The use of `long long` for the exponent ensures compatibility with large exponent values and prevents overflow during intermediate calculations.

- **How does the exponentiation by squaring technique work?**
  - Exponentiation by squaring efficiently reduces the number of multiplications required by halving the exponent in each iteration and squaring the base. This approach significantly improves the performance of exponentiation operations, especially for large exponents.

- **Why is the reciprocal taken for negative exponents?**
  - Taking the reciprocal of the result ensures accurate computation of fractional powers when the exponent is negative. It effectively flips the base and exponent, resulting in the desired fractional power.

- **What are the advantages of handling overflow conditions?**
  - Handling overflow conditions ensures that the function produces correct results within the bounds of the integer type. By detecting potential overflow and clamping the result, the implementation enhances reliability and prevents unexpected behavior.

#### Conclusion

The `myPow` implementation demonstrates an efficient and robust approach to computing powers using the exponentiation by squaring technique. The code incorporates optimizations for both performance and accuracy, making it suitable for a wide range of applications requiring exponentiation operations.




## To solve the power function \( \text{pow}(x, n) \) using recursion,


this code doesnt work unless the negative case is taken care of, this is just to learn recursion 

To solve the power function \( \text{pow}(x, n) \) using recursion, you need to define a base condition to stop the recursion. The base condition for the power function can be derived from the mathematical definition of exponentiation:

1. Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
2. Any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Here's a simple implementation using recursion:

### Base Condition
The base conditions for this recursive function are:
1. If \( n == 0 \), return 1 (since \( x^0 = 1 \)).
2. If \( n == 1 \), return \( x \) (since \( x^1 = x \)).

### Recursive Step
For the recursive step, we reduce the problem size by breaking it down into smaller subproblems:
- If \( n \) is even, we can use the property \( x^n = (x^{n/2})^2 \).
- If \( n \) is odd, we can use the property \( x^n = x \times x^{n-1} \).

### Implementation
Here’s a simple implementation in C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        // Handle the case of negative exponents
        if (n < 0) {
            x = 1 / x;
            n = -n;
        }
        
        // Base condition
        if (n == 0) return 1;  // x^0 = 1
        if (n == 1) return x;  // x^1 = x
        
        // Recursive step
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            double half = myPow(x, n / 2);
            return half * half;
        } else {
            return x * myPow(x, n - 1);
        }
    }
};
```
### Recursion Tree for `myPow(2, 5)`

We’ll represent each recursive call as a node in the tree. Each node will show the function call and its parameters.

1. **Root Node: `myPow(2, 5)`**
   - \( n \) is odd, so it will split into:
     - `2 * myPow(2, 4)`

2. **First Level: `myPow(2, 4)`**
   - \( n \) is even, so it will split into:
     - `myPow(2, 2) * myPow(2, 2)`

3. **Second Level: `myPow(2, 2)`**
   - \( n \) is even, so it will split into:
     - `myPow(2, 1) * myPow(2, 1)`

4. **Third Level: `myPow(2, 1)`**
   - \( n \) is 1, so it returns `2`.

### Explanation of the Tree

1. **Root Node (`myPow(2, 5)`)**:
   - This call splits into `2 * myPow(2, 4)` because \( n \) is odd.

2. **First Level (`myPow(2, 4)`)**:
   - This call splits into `myPow(2, 2) * myPow(2, 2)` because \( n \) is even.

3. **Second Level (`myPow(2, 2)`)**:
   - This call splits into `myPow(2, 1) * myPow(2, 1)` because \( n \) is even.

4. **Third Level (`myPow(2, 1)`)**:
   - This call returns `2` because \( n \) is 1 (base case).

5. **Combining Results**:
   - `myPow(2, 1)` returns `2`, so `myPow(2, 2)` becomes `2 * 2 = 4`.
   - `myPow(2, 4)` becomes `4 * 4 = 16`.
   - Finally, `myPow(2, 5)` becomes `2 * 16 = 32`.
