### Notes for Subset Sum II Problem

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

#### Example:
1. **Input:** `nums = [1,2,2]`
   - **Output:** `[[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]`
   
2. **Input:** `nums = [0]`
   - **Output:** `[[],[0]]`

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`

### Approach:

1. **Sort the Array:**
   - Sorting helps to handle duplicates efficiently by grouping them together. This makes it easier to skip duplicates in the recursive function.

2. **Backtracking:**
   - Use a recursive function to generate all possible subsets.
   - At each recursion level, decide whether to include the current element in the subset or not.

3. **Avoid Duplicates:**
   - Skip adding a duplicate element to a subset if it has already been considered in the current recursion level.
   - This is achieved by checking if the current element is the same as the previous one and ensuring it is not the starting element of the subset (`i > start`).

4. **Base Case:**
   - When the recursion reaches the end of the array, add the current subset to the result.

### Recursive Function Structure:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Sort the input array.
   - Initialize the result vector and the temporary subset vector.
   
2. **Recursive Backtracking Function:**
   - Add the current subset to the result.
   - Iterate through the array from the `start` index to the end.
   - Skip duplicates by checking if the current element is the same as the previous one and ensuring it is not the first element of the subset.
   - Include the current element in the subset and recurse to the next level.
   - Backtrack by removing the last added element.

### Code Implementation in C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    void backTrack(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& result, vector<int>& subset, int start) {
        result.push_back(subset);  // Add the current subset to the result

        for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            // Skip duplicates: if current element is the same as previous and not at the start of the subset
            if (i > start && nums[i] == nums[i - 1])
                continue;

            subset.push_back(nums[i]);  // Include nums[i] in the subset
            backTrack(nums, result, subset, i + 1);  // Recurse with next index
            subset.pop_back();  // Backtrack: remove nums[i] from the subset
        }
    }

public:
    vector<vector<int>> subsetsWithDup(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        vector<int> subset;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());  // Sort to handle duplicates
        backTrack(nums, result, subset, 0);
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sort the Array:**
   - `sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());` ensures that duplicates are adjacent.

2. **Backtracking Function (`backTrack`):**
   - `result.push_back(subset);` adds the current subset to the result.
   - `for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); ++i)` iterates through the array starting from `start`.
   - `if (i > start && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;` skips duplicates.
   - `subset.push_back(nums[i]);` includes the current element in the subset.
   - `backTrack(nums, result, subset, i + 1);` recurses with the next index.
   - `subset.pop_back();` backtracks by removing the last added element.

### Summary:
- Sorting the array helps to manage duplicates.
- The backtracking function explores all possible subsets, skipping duplicates appropriately.
- Each subset, including the empty one, is added to the result.
- The solution ensures all subsets are unique by leveraging sorted order and skipping duplicates during recursion.
