### Overview

The primary goal of the code is to sort a stack in ascending order without using any additional data structures. The sorting is achieved by inserting elements into a new stack (`sorted_stack`) in a sorted manner. The key idea is to pop elements from the original stack and push them back in sorted order into the `sorted_stack`.

### Recursion in Sorting Stack

Recursion plays a crucial role in this sorting mechanism. The `sortStack` function is responsible for popping all elements from the original stack and then reinserting them into the `sorted_stack` in sorted order. This process inherently involves recursion because the function calls itself to handle the remaining elements in the stack.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Base Case**: The `sortStack` function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the function returns without doing anything. This serves as the base case for the recursion, stopping the recursion when there are no more elements to process.

2. **Recursive Step**:
   - The function pops the top element from the original stack.
   - It then calls itself (`sortStack(stack)`) to recursively sort the remaining elements in the stack.
   - After the recursive call returns, the function inserts the popped element into the `sorted_stack` in its correct sorted position using the `InsertInSortedOrder` helper function.

3. **Helper Function (`InsertInSortedOrder`)**: This function ensures that the element is inserted into the `sorted_stack` in sorted order. It compares the element with the top element of the `sorted_stack`:
   - If the `sorted_stack` is empty or the element is greater than the top element of the `sorted_stack`, the element is pushed onto the `sorted_stack`.
   - Otherwise, the top element of the `sorted_stack` is temporarily removed, the element is inserted, and then the removed element is pushed back onto the `sorted_stack`.

### Recursion Depth

The maximum depth of recursion in this algorithm is equal to the height of the stack, which is the total number of elements in the stack. Each recursive call processes one element, so the depth of recursion directly corresponds to the number of elements in the stack.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this sorting algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the stack. This is because, for each element, the `InsertInSortedOrder` function potentially traverses the entire `sorted_stack` to find the correct insertion point. The space complexity is O(n) for the auxiliary stack used to store the sorted elements.

### Conclusion

This code provides an interesting example of using recursion to solve a seemingly non-recursive problem. By leveraging recursion to manage the stack's elements, the algorithm sorts the stack in ascending order without needing any additional data structures beyond the stacks themselves.

To understand the recursive process in sorting a stack using the given code, let's break down the recursive calls and visualize the recursion tree. We'll use a smaller stack to keep things manageable. Let's assume the initial stack is `3, 1, 4, 2`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Initial Call**: 
    - `sortStack({3, 1, 4, 2})`
    - Pops `2`, recursively calls `sortStack({3, 1, 4})`.

2. **Second Call**: 
    - `sortStack({3, 1, 4})`
    - Pops `4`, recursively calls `sortStack({3, 1})`.

3. **Third Call**: 
    - `sortStack({3, 1})`
    - Pops `1`, recursively calls `sortStack({3})`.

4. **Fourth Call**: 
    - `sortStack({3})`
    - Pops `3`, recursively calls `sortStack({})`.

5. **Base Case**: 
    - `sortStack({})`
    - Stack is empty, returns to the previous call.

### Unwinding the Recursion and Inserting Elements

- **Returning to Fourth Call**: 
    - `InsertInSortedOrder({}, 3)` inserts `3` into the empty stack, results in `{3}`.
  
- **Returning to Third Call**:
    - `InsertInSortedOrder({3}, 1)`:
        - Pops `3`, inserts `1`, then reinserts `3` back, resulting in `{1, 3}`.

- **Returning to Second Call**:
    - `InsertInSortedOrder({1, 3}, 4)`:
        - Since `4` is greater than `3`, it is inserted on top, resulting in `{1, 3, 4}`.

- **Returning to Initial Call**:
    - `InsertInSortedOrder({1, 3, 4}, 2)`:
        - Pops `4` and `3`, inserts `2`, then reinserts `3` and `4`, resulting in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

### Visualizing the Recursion Tree

```
sortStack({3, 1, 4, 2})
|
|-- sortStack({3, 1, 4})
|   |
|   |-- sortStack({3, 1})
|   |   |
|   |   |-- sortStack({3})
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |-- sortStack({})
|   |   |   |   --> Base case: return
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |-- InsertInSortedOrder({}, 3)
|   |   |       --> Stack after insert: {3}
|   |
|   |-- InsertInSortedOrder({3}, 1)
|       --> Stack after insert: {1, 3}
|
|-- InsertInSortedOrder({1, 3}, 4)
    --> Stack after insert: {1, 3, 4}

InsertInSortedOrder({1, 3, 4}, 2)
--> Stack after insert: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### Detailed Step-by-Step Unwinding

1. **Insert `3` into the empty stack**: 
    - `InsertInSortedOrder({}, 3)`: Stack becomes `{3}`.

2. **Insert `1` into `{3}`**:
    - `InsertInSortedOrder({3}, 1)`:
        - Pops `3`, inserts `1`, then reinserts `3`: Stack becomes `{1, 3}`.

3. **Insert `4` into `{1, 3}`**:
    - `InsertInSortedOrder({1, 3}, 4)`:
        - Since `4` is greater than `3`, directly insert `4`: Stack becomes `{1, 3, 4}`.

4. **Insert `2` into `{1, 3, 4}`**:
    - `InsertInSortedOrder({1, 3, 4}, 2)`:
        - Pops `4` and `3`, inserts `2`, then reinserts `3` and `4`: Stack becomes `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

### Conclusion
The recursion tree shows each step of popping the top element until the stack is empty, and then reinserting elements in sorted order as the recursion unwinds. Each recursive call reduces the problem size by one, and `InsertInSortedOrder` places each element in its correct position in the sorted stack. This approach demonstrates a clear use of recursion to solve the problem of sorting a stack.
